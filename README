Project by CAO Kha Bao Khanh - 2017

This is a simulation of a scientific calculator that I did around 10/2017 for a university project. 
To compile simply use gcc -std=c99 *.c -o calculator -lm and execute using ./calculator
The calculator has 4 main mode of operations:   
  + single operations: like 1+1 or cos(60)
  + complex number mode: doing operations on complex numbers
  + matrix arithmetics: add, multiply matrices as well as finding their determinant and inverse
  + function generator: to store a specific function f(x) and then easily calculate a range of value for x, or finding its intergral and derivative
There is syntax guide when the program is launched.
